A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine.Small vinyl cutters look like computer printer.The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade.This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheet of thin self-adhesive plastic(vinyl).A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen.A vector based design is created in a software program  (usually Adobe illustrator or Corel Draw) and then send to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design.The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material,cutting it into any shape imaginable.
