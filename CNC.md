CNC router (or Computer Numerical Control router) is a computer-controlled cutting machine related to hand held router used for cutting various hard materials,such as wood,composites,aluminum,steel,plastics and foams.

Almost all machines accepts "gcode"file for operations.Similarly the ShopBot also accepts the"gcode"file for PCB milling.Hence the circuit design inany of the format must be converted to"gcode" format.Thus we use fabmodules.org


## Steps for the generating "gcode"file



*Open fabmodules.org.




*Now select the input,either as image(.png or jpeg),drawing or mesh etc...




*Now select the output format.Here we selected the ".sbp" format.




*Finally the process need to be selected.Here we selected "Foam(rough cut 1/8)".
